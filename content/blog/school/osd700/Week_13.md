As apart of week 13 I’m trying to continue changing the PR’s I had before in Cockatrice. Though the thing I wanted to try going forward into the future is to try to work on projects that I actually use since I feel like that’s bit of the idea of open source where you have an issue with the software so you can solve it since it’s all open. But then that goes into the whole idea from before where since it’s kind of democratized then some people or projects get overlooked since they aren’t as flashy or cause there’s not as much avocation from developers on developing apps to be accessible.
