Hi, so the PR was pretty simple, the main thing was figuring out how to deal with git since there were PRs made on the project made after my inital PR so I had to figure out how to make a new branch that just had the stuff from the original repo, and also just figuring out what the issue was since I encountered an issue with the spyder while trying to setup my enviornment again cause I'm on a new laptop and their documentation said to run a certain spyder just as a test so I did that and it was an error but on the code end and not on my setup. I also figured out how to use pipenv better with vscode since vscode kept prompting to create a new environment but with their thing.
