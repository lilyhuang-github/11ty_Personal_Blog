The release tool and package registry I choose was npm because bun just uses the npm package registry and the tool should still work when using npm. https://www.npmjs.com/package/rat-assistant

The process of creating a release for me was just changing the version tag in the package json and giving the git version tag.

The main thing I learnt was making the annotated tags to indicate the version.

I didn't really change much, I just changed the version to 1.0.0 since that's the main thing npm wanted.

The way uses would install the package would be with npm using: npm i rat-assistant
https://www.npmjs.com/package/rat-assistant
