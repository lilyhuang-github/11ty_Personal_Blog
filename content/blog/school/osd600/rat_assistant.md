More features.

So I added some more features. It taking in multiple models and using each of them over. And also letting them use the streaming mode.

So the main thing was resolving the merge conflict cause it was slightly confusing and I kind of wanted to understand it better cause I understand how the code works cause I wrote it but in a more normal situation I'd probably wouldn't fully get how the code works and would just need to change it enough in a way I understand to merge them.

Also I think this might make sense with how things are developed. Cause like if you have a huge mound and everyones working on it at once then a merging conflict would probably be insane to fix so just breaking things up into different files even if you can just have stuff in 1 file would make sense cause you can just split things up.
