Rebasing

It was pretty interesting to do. Like I've never really needed/wanted to rebase stuff since if it works then it works. Like I've never really needed to rebase an assignment since I just needed to get it working and it's also hand holdy, but also for personal projects I didn't really need to either since I just need to get it to work.
