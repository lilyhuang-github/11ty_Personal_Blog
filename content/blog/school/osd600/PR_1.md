So I did my first PR and it's kinda insane.
My main issue was finding an issue I could solve cause some issues are too complex to me to fix or something that I don't really care about.

With this it's more or less fits the 2 issues cause it's like a rainbow six siege counter visualizer and I've played r6 before and there were some issues that felt attainable to me.

The issue was like it's made with an older version of npm/node so it could use some changing to be compatable with a newer one but it was a bit more involved than I expected but I felt like it was something I could do.

Like the main thing was weather or not what I was doing was solving the issue or if I just enter a big recursive loop of breaking and fixing things. Like I change a dependency and then it breaks another one so then I have to fix that and then that might not be the good way to do it.

But thankfully it wasn't that bad cause I just needed to get it running and not change every single deprecated dependency.
