Hi, this is an overview of the PRs made over the month. I unfortunately on made 3 PRs, I might try to make a 4th PR later but I might not, I just couldn't find a good issue to work on that was more difficult than the previous PRs I made but something I had an idea on how to fix.

I think I learned a lot. My first PR was kinda just messing around with npm/trying to make the packages in a project work for the newer version of node/npm, that one, it was something I thought I could do since it didn't seem to hard, the only problem was that it wasn't clear if what I was doing was fixing it or not. But it worked out.

Second PR was on the same project but adding in new/missing content since the project was kind of deprecated since the game the project was based on continued to update, so the content in the project was old at that point, so I just had to figure out how the project was designed and add in the new content which also was some what simple. Like I didn't really have to come up with my own stuff, it's just copying the existing things and changing it to fit the new content.

The 3rd PR was a different project. It was a scraping one with the python spyder. That was a bit different cause they had their own documentation and the documentation was really helpful but also somewhat not helpful in certain areas. Like there was a link that was dead and didn't lead anywhere and the link was supposed to explain how you could deal with scraping an asp.net type website since that sends out the html with like place holders, like the handlebar type stuff, and then uses js to fill in the blanks, which was a bit to figure out that that was the issue, so I kind of gave up on that issue and switched to a different issue that doesn't deal with asp.net and made a spyder for it which was kinda fun.

Hypothetically I would've probably learned a lot from a 4th PR but it's just kinda hard.
