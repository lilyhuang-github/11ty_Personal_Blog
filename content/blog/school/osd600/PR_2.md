I think this PR was pretty normal. Like it was basically maintenance on the same project I worked on in PR 1. It was for the Rainbow Six Siege counters https://github.com/BurkusCat/r6-operator-counters. Like a lot of the content became outdated through time since the game continues to get updates which means the repo is behind as it continues to deprecate. But it was kinda interesting trying to figure out how the code works and adding to it. Adding to it in it of itself wasn't too difficult, it was just a bit monotonous. I thought about trying to make a script that could automatically add a character to it but it seemed like a lot more effort than changing/adding like 4 or 5 files that are very templated each time a new character gets released, which is every 4 months potentially. So it's not much work. The part that is a lot more work is figuring out the counters for each character. That's a bit more of you have to know the game to understand that and add.

##### EDitors Note (2025-06-17) This is out of order with PR 3 since I forgot to post this one.
