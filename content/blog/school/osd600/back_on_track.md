ok, so back on track.

My names Lily and I just want to be able to work on open source stuff. I forgot what exactly I wrote on the dev to blog cause I wrote a bunch of stuff but now its gone but there was this sticker maker repo that I wanted to add onto https://st.ayaka.one/, it's like a sticker maker thing based on project sekai and I wanted to add a bunch of features so then it could hypothetically be a bandori sticker maker. They're both like mobile rhythm games and they got stickers.

So I kinda want to learn how to be able to contribute to a project cause it's like real hard to figure out how the persons making the project work. Like the sekai sticker one, there's some things in the code that I noticed but I wasn't sure if it was on purpose or just they just banged something up and its something i could fix. So, yeah I want to be able to fix stuff.

A lot of my links are gone/I forgot but there's so repos that I liked

https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt
I just like it as tool, it's pretty cool so I want to be able to contribute

https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX
This one kinda interesting. I don't entirely understand this based on my understanding of what docker is, like I don't get the point of this.

https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock
This one its like osint tool, and I've done osint type searching on people before so.

There was one other but idk I cant find it.
