So I did a pull request on an open source project. https://github.com/brokoli777/RefactorCode/pull/4

I didn't change much to add the token usage flag. I just needed to add the option which format wise is really similar to yargs, and then have it handle the flag. There wasn't too much of a problem cause I could see a lot of patterns in it in my code like the formatting being like yargs but slightly different, and the stuff that gemini returns is slightly different and a bit of how stuff is arranged is also a bit different. But I think it went well.

#### Editors Note (2025-06-17) This was in 2024, and I've done a lot more open source development so I've developed a lot more opinions about it
