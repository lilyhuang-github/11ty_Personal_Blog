its kinda sad looking at repos that have been kinda abandoned. like they haven't had a recent commit. it feels like a dead internet net thing or like you know, like what happened to these people and how are they. you'know like did they move on with their lives, cause sometimes in the contributions they're like really empty and it's like, who were you. like hozier - someone new, it's kinda like that, I'm learning about someone through their repo
