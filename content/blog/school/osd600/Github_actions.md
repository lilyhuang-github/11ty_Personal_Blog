For the github actions the was something I took from somewhere else but changed it a bit since it ran a specific file with bun rather than go through testing with bun.

My partner's repo was a bit different since it used jest rather than bun's testing stuff but it looks pretty much the same.

I'm not sure what I think about continuous integration now that I've set it up since I'm not sure how it would apply to a real thing and how it would differ to a real project.
