So this is the third PR and it's kinda arggg. Like I didn't really write a lot of code. It's more of just a lot of reading and figuring things out and figuring out how stuff works. Like I made a scrapy spider, or atleast I started trying to but there was an issue cause it's the whole dynamiclly loaded javascript type website, like an aspx website/asp.net website which makes it a bit trickier which I tried figuring out and looking at the other spiders the repo had and it was kinda hard. But then I just went to a different issue that didn't need to deal with that cause I figured out that was what the issue was. But it was a lot. Like I spent a good while trying to fix/make it do the thing but not install need libraries cause I assume they wouldn't want that. But I learnt a lot but also not that much at the same time. Like I don't entirely get how this project saves all the data it gets from the spiders but I get how you can/do make a spider. Like I get more or less how they arraged the class-ness of the spiders and how you could implement it. I learned a bit more regex. It's really a lot of regex and like selecting things and also needing to figure out how to open a pdf.
